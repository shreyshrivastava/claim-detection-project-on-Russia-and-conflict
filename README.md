# claim-detection-project-on-Russia-and-conflict
An automated system combining BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) and SVM (Support Vector Machine) for claim detection and fact-checking in news articles, focusing on Russia-Ukraine conflict coverage. Features include RSS feed processing, real-time analysis, and machine learning-based verification.

# Project Description
This project implements an automated system for detecting claims and performing fact-checking on news articles, with a specific focus on coverage of the Russia-Ukraine conflict. The system combines the power of BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) with Support Vector Machines (SVM) to create a robust pipeline for analyzing news content.

## Key Features
- **BERT-Based Claim Detection**: Utilizes state-of-the-art transformer models to identify claims within text
- **SVM Classification**: Implements machine learning for precise categorization of detected claims
- **RSS Feed Integration**: Automatically processes news from RSS feeds for real-time analysis
- **Specialized for Conflict Coverage**: Tailored for analyzing news related to the Russia-Ukraine conflict
- **Scalable Architecture**: Designed to handle multiple news sources and different types of claims

## Technical Stack
- PyTorch for deep learning implementation
- Transformers library for BERT model
- Scikit-learn for SVM and machine learning pipeline
- Pandas and NumPy for data processing
- Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualization
- FeedParser for RSS feed handling

## Applications
- News verification and fact-checking
- Automated claim detection in news articles
- Analysis of media coverage patterns
- Information reliability assessment
- Real-time news monitoring

## Research Context
This project contributes to the broader field of automated fact-checking and misinformation detection, particularly crucial in the context of contemporary international conflicts where information accuracy is vital.

## Future Development
- Integration with additional news sources
- Enhanced multi-language support
- Real-time fact verification
- API development for broader accessibility
- Integration with existing fact-checking databases
